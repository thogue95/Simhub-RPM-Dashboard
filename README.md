Simple RPM with Peak

This is a an RPM gauge that was modified from Wotever's Dashboard.  The RPM guage resets the peak RPM upon shift.  So you may need to left off the gas before shifting to the gear you are looking to capture the peak.


Unzip in your download directory and copy unzipped folder and contents into C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\DashTemplates as you would when installing any other dashboard or overlay.
